Machine Learning Using Continuous Data
---------------------------
We will begin with a recap on linear modelling and then continue onto how we can delve deeper into our data and see how it may change in the future ! We are using `knn.reg` to make projections, using algorithms from observed data. This is a continuation from the Machine Learning in R Turorial (see here- https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning/) except we will look at continuous data rather than categorical. Finally, we will map out these projections and see how these can be visualised for communicating results.

### Background Info

Often when analysing data in ecology and environmental science we use modelling to determine the effect explanatory variables have on response variables such as linear regression and generalised linear models. For example, we can determine the extent to which climate change impacts temperatures or precipitation rates in different areas by looking at observed data over time. 
But what if we want to see how this will change in the future? Machine learning can be a useful tool to make projections on future climate trends. In this tutorial we will use a basic k NN regression to demonstrate the potential for using Rstudio to project continuous data using algorithms, with the example of annual temperatures across the UK. We will then look at how these projections can be communicated.

NOTE: This tutorial aims to introduce the ideas of k NN regression however there is always a level of uncertainty when making projections.

You can get all of the resources for this tutorial from <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-EAB-tut-ideas" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>. Clone and download the repo as a zip file, then unzip it.

## Getting Started
We will be using the dataset uk.long.csv, so be sure to setwd to where you located the unzipped files. We will be using the following packages, so make sure to have them downloaded and loaded onto a new `R Script`:

```r
# Set the working directory
setwd("your_filepath")

# Load packages
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(tidymodels)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(gmodels)
library(randomForest)
library(FNN)
library(ggeffects)
```
First, lets inspect our data:

```r
str(uk_long)  # view structure of data
head(uk_long)  # get summary of first 6 rows
```


We can see that we have a dataset with 3 variables, 'year', 'ann' and 'Country'. Here 'ann' is annual mean temperature. 

### Lets visualise our data
(TIP: use () in the command to automatically see the plot!)

```r
(scatter <- ggplot(uk_long, aes(x = year, y = ann, colour = Country))+  # use ggplot to make scatter plot
    geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.6)+  # adjust size of line
    theme_classic()+
    theme(legend.position = 'right'))  # move legend to the right
```

We could model this data to determine the extent of the trends in our data.
First find the distribution:

```r
hist(uk_long$ann)  # plot histogram to see distribution of our data
```
<img width = '500' height = '400' src= 'https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a41073af-e873-45ee-9953-1f31d1ec5f10' />


As our trends are normally distributed we could use a linear regression to show the changes in temperature over time in each country. 

```r
annual_lm <- lm(ann ~ year + Country, data = uk_long)  # model considering country as a fixed effect

summary(annual_lm)  # summary table of model

```
Output:
```r
Coefficients:
                         Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)             -8.439224   0.995177  -8.480  < 2e-16 ***
year                     0.009033   0.000509  17.747  < 2e-16 ***
CountryNorthern Ireland -0.584786   0.058182 -10.051  < 2e-16 ***
CountryScotland         -2.055071   0.058182 -35.322  < 2e-16 ***
CountryWales            -0.419857   0.058182  -7.216 1.76e-12 ***
```
Our output shows that generally there is an increase in 0.009 째C per year (from the estimate column for 'year'. 'year' is the reference country, which in this case is England. The table also tells us that Northern Ireland is on average 0.58 째C, Scotland 2째C and Wales 0.42째C cooler than England.

We can check the model is appropriate by checking the residuals

```r
plot(annual_lm)
```
Which gives us:


<img width = '500' height = '400' src= 'https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82e9a77b-5403-48de-919a-f42ce9b62f6a' />

So our model has a good fit ! Which shows that the estimates on increases per year are pretty accurate:)

## 2. The second section

You can add more text and code, e.g.

```r
# Create fake data
x_dat <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 5, sd = 2)  # x data
y_dat <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 10, sd = 0.2)  # y data
xy <- data.frame(x_dat, y_dat)  # combine into data frame
```

Here you can add some more text if you wish.

```r
xy_fil <- xy %>%  # Create object with the contents of `xy`
	filter(x_dat < 7.5)  # Keep rows where `x_dat` is less than 7.5
```

And finally, plot the data:

```r
ggplot(data = xy_fil, aes(x = x_dat, y = y_dat)) +  # Select the data to use
	geom_point() +  # Draw scatter points
	geom_smooth(method = "loess")  # Draw a loess curve
```

At this point it would be a good idea to include an image of what the plot is meant to look like so students can check they've done it right. Replace `IMAGE_NAME.png` with your own image file:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/IMAGE_NAME.png" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/> </center>

##### - how to generate fake bivariate data
##### - how to create a scatterplot in ggplot2
##### - some of the different plot methods in ggplot2

We can also provide some useful links, include a contact form and a way to send feedback.
